## Stack Overflow Topic Modeling Project
# Overview
This project involves scraping data from Stack Overflow, applying three different topic modeling techniques (LDA, LSA, and BERTopic), and comparing their performance and outputs. 
The goal is to extract meaningful topics from Stack Overflow posts, providing insights into the most discussed subjects in the developer community.

# Data Collection:

Navigate to the scraper directory.
Run the scraping script to collect data from Stack Overflow

# Running the Models:

Navigate to the models directory and execute the modelling scripts.

# Usage
Use the scraper scripts to gather the latest data from Stack Overflow.
Run each topic modeling script to generate topics from the data.
Visualize the results using the provided visualization scripts.
Compare the outputs of different models to analyze their effectiveness.

# Acknowledgments

Stack Overflow for being an invaluable resource for developers.
Creators of the LDA, LSA, and BERTopic algorithms.
